## Echoes of the History of Science

This repository contains the code and engineering components for the project Echoes of the History of Science, which integrates fundamental scientific concepts with artistic expression through music and visual art. The project explores five key case studies—Monte Carlo sampling, fractal mathematics, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the Lorenz attractor, and quantum mechanics—transforming them into dynamic, real-time audio-visual experiences using tools like SuperCollider, TouchDesigner, and Ableton Live.

The code includes implementations of Monte Carlo simulations, fractal generation, entropy calculations, and Lorenz attractor dynamics, all integrated into an interactive audio-visual system. These elements are synchronized using OSC (Open Sound Control) messaging, allowing for real-time interaction between sound and visuals.

The repository is designed to support further exploration, adaptation, and extension of these methods, making it a valuable resource for researchers and creators interested in the intersection of science, art, and technology.
